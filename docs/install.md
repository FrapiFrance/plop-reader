This application allows you to read entries from your [Wallabag v2](https://www.wallabag.org/) instance, on your [Pocketbook Touch Lux](http://www.pocketbook-int.com/fr/products/pocketbook-touch-lux-3).

**Download the current version of the application: [Plop! reader v0.2.1](/releases/v0.2.1/Plop! reader.app)**

To use the application, you must follow **two steps** :

 * Send the application to your ereader.
 * Create a configuration file on your ereader.


## Send the application to the device

After connecting the ereader to your computer with an USB cable, you must send the `Plop! reader.app` file to the ereader, in `/applications/` :

Note: `/applications/`, by default, is a hidden directory and not might be visible on your computer by defaut.

It will then be visible in the applications drawer of the ereader:

## Configuration file

You must create a JSON file, called `config.json`, from the following template:

```json
{
    "url": "YOUR WALLABAG INSTANCE URL",
    "client_id": "CLIENT_ID GENERATED BY WALLABAG",
    "secret_key": "SECRET KEY GENERATED BY WALLABAG",
    "login": "YOUR LOGIN",
    "password": "YOUR PASSWORD"
}
```

*Note: to create a client id and secret key, go to the `Developer` screen of your Wallabag instance.*

If your Wallabag instance is protected by HTTP-Basic, you can use the following template instead (but take a look at [this wallabag issue](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/2278)):

```json
{
    "url": "YOUR WALLABAG INSTANCE URL",
    "http_login": "HTTP-BASIC LOGIN",
    "http_password": "HTTP-BASIC PASSWORD",
    "client_id": "CLIENT_ID GENERATED BY WALLABAG",
    "secret_key": "SECRET KEY GENERATED BY WALLABAG",
    "login": "YOUR LOGIN",
    "password": "YOUR PASSWORD"
}
```

After connecting your ereader to your computer with an USB cable, you must send this `config.json` file to the ereader, in `/system/share/plop-reader` (you might have to create that last directory):

Note: the `database.sqlite3` file seen on this screenshot will be created automatically by the application, you don't have to do anything regarding this file and should never modify it yourself.


## Using the application

When first running the application, its screen is quite empty, as you haven't fetched any entry from the server yet:

![Empty screen at first launch](/images/v0.1.0/screenshot-11-empty-screen-at-first-launch.png)

This is the same screen - the main screen of the application - when entries have been fetched from the server:

![The main screen](/images/v0.1.0/screenshot-01-main-screen.png)

You have 3 buttons in the header:

 * On the left, the button to *close* the application.
 * On the left of the right half the screen, the *sync* button: use it to fetch entries from the server and to send local statuses to the server.
 * On the far right of the screen, the *menu* button.

Touching the *sync* button runs a synchronization between your ereader and the server:

Touching the *menu* button opens the following menu:

From this menu, you can open the About screen:

![The about dialog](/images/v0.1.0/screenshot-03-about.png)

The *menu* button also allows you to navigate between the lists of unread / archived / starred entries:

![The archived entries](/images/v0.1.0/screenshot-04-archived.png) ![The starred entries](/images/v0.1.0/screenshot-05-starred.png)

In each of these lists, you can use the <kbd>left</kbd> and <kbd>right</kbd> physical keys of your device to navigate between pages of entries.

To read an entry, touch it; and the ereader's internal reading application will start (it takes a few seconds):

When you are done reading an entry, close the reading app by touching the upper-left corner of the screen, and you'll get this dialog, which asks you if you want to change the status information of the entry you just read:

## Troubles?

If you experience problems, two options:

 * Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/pmartin/plop-reader/issues) on github and create one if needed
 * Send me a mail ;-)

In any case: feel free to send me a mail even if you don't run into troubles. I'm really interested by the opinion of some power-users of Wallabag, especially if you've used this app in *real conditions* for a few days!
