title:  "Plop! reader v0.3.1: faster EPUB downloads (with wallabag v2.2)"
date:   2017-01-06

Here's a new release of **Plop! reader**, an application allowing you to read entries from your [Wallabag v2](https://www.wallabag.org/) instance, on your [Pocketbook / TEA Touch Lux 3](http://www.pocketbook-int.com/fr/products/pocketbook-touch-lux-3).

For more informations:

 * [Installation and configuration](/install-and-configure.html) **‚Üê READ THIS!**
 * [Features](/features.html)

**Download: [Plop! reader v0.3.1](/releases/v0.3.1/Plop! reader.app)**

This is still an early version, which means your feedback is important!

<br>

Starting from v0.3.0, this application downloads an EPUB version of each entry from your wallabag server, provided it supports export of entries as EPUB -- **which means you need wallabag >= 2.2** -- released a few days ago! I've also had reports indicating it works with [wallabag.it](https://www.wallabag.it/).

With v0.3.1, several EPUB files are downloaded in parallel, which means synchronization should go much faster than before:

Note: to speed sync up even more, the EPUB version of an entry is only downloaded when the entry is synced from the server **for the first time** and only for entries that are *unread* or *starred*: it's never updated later on the ereader. This might (or might not) change in the future, depending on feedback.

<br>

This v0.3.1 also adds a `Delete all local data` item in the context-menu of the application:

After touching this item, you'll be asked to confirm:

![Delete all local data?](/images/v0.3.1/screenshot-reset-all-data.png)

If you confirm in this dialog, all **local data** (and only data local to your ereader) will be deleted (nothing will be changed on the server-side), **including all changes you might have done on the ereader and not synchronized to the server yet**.

This feature should only be used if you encounter some *strange* behavior within the application -- especially if there is a bug that causes synchronization to fail (don't forget to report the bug ;-) )
