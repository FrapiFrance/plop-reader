Here are a few notes about the **private beta version 0.1.0** of Plop! reader.

**Download: [Plop! reader v0.1.0](http://extern.pascal-martin.fr/plop-reader/v0.1.0/Plop! reader.app)**

**⚠ You must follow the installation / configuration steps, or the application will segfault ⚠**

## Warning

**This application is a *pre-version*. It is *unstable* and might wreck havoc on your device and in your Wallabag instance! Use at your own perils!**

Known limitations of this v0.1.0 version:

 * Only tested on Pocketbook Touch Lux 3 "TEA" with a 5.14 firmware and Pocketbook Touch Lux 2 "TEA" with a 5.9 firmware
 * It will not work on a 4.x firmware
 * It only supports Wallabag 2.x (which means it doesn't work with *Framabag*) and has only been tested with Wallabag 2.0.6 and 2.0.8
 * At first launch, when no sync has been ever done, the screen is a bit empty.
 * Not much help included.
 * Far from perfect UI.
 * Only reads HTML content of the entries -- which means no images (they are remote and not fetched) and some encoding problems for special characters.
 * Much code-rework is needed.
 * There is not much error-handling at all: a missing or invalid config file will certainly cause a crash, for instance.

This is a **private beta version**, to collect useful feedback from implicated power-users, before doing any public release of this application. Please note v0.2.0 should be a *public beta*, even if still directed to power-users (able to create a JSON config file, for instance).

I've used this application for a couple of weeks now, including two week-ends offline and it seems to work... But, as you surely know, there are always things the developer of an application didn't think about ;-)


## Features

### Implemented

Here's a quick short list of features that are currently implemented and should work in this v0.1.0 release:

 * Fetching the 200 most recent entries from the server and synchronizing them to the ereader.
 * Marking an entry as *archived* or *starred* on the ereader.
 * Synchronizing this change to the server.
 * Works offline and only accesses the network when you touch the *sync* button (reactivating wifi if need be).
 * Three distinct lists: unread, archived, starred; and *menu* button to switch between lists.
 * Uses the internal ereader's reading application to open contents, which means you have all the usual *reading* features and options.
 * Logs to `plop-reader-log.html` at the root the device; which means this log can be read from the library and you can get it via USB.


### Not implemented, but planned

Many things are not implemented yet, but are planned for (several) future versions. Most of them are tracked as [issues on github](https://github.com/pmartin/plop-reader/issues).


## Installing and configuring the application

### Send the application to the device

After connecting the ereader to your computer with an USB cable, you must send the `Plop! reader.app` file to the ereader, in `/applications/` :

![The 'application' directory](/images/v0.1.0/directory-application.png)

It will then be visible in the applications drawer of the ereader:

### Configuration file

You must create a JSON file, called `config.json`, from the following template:

```json
{
    "url": "YOUR WALLABAG INSTANCE URL",
    "client_id": "CLIENT_ID GENERATED BY WALLABAG",
    "secret_key": "SECRET KEY GENERATED BY WALLABAG",
    "login": "YOUR LOGIN",
    "password": "YOUR PASSWORD"
}
```

*Note: to create a client id and secret key, go to the `Developer` screen of your Wallabag instance.*

If your Wallabag instance is protected by HTTP-Basic, you can use the following template (but take a look at [this wallabag issue](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/2278)):

```json
{
    "url": "YOUR WALLABAG INSTANCE URL",
    "http_login": "HTTP-BASIC LOGIN",
    "http_password": "HTTP-BASIC PASSWORD",
    "client_id": "CLIENT_ID GENERATED BY WALLABAG",
    "secret_key": "SECRET KEY GENERATED BY WALLABAG",
    "login": "YOUR LOGIN",
    "password": "YOUR PASSWORD"
}
```

After connecting your ereader to your computer with an USB cable, you must send this `config.json` file to the ereader, in `/system/share/plop-reader` (you might have to create that last directory):

## Using the application

When first running the application, its screen is quite empty, as you haven't fetched any entry from the server:

![Empty screen at first launch](/images/v0.1.0/screenshot-11-empty-screen-at-first-launch.png)

This is the main screen of the application, when entries have already been fetched from the server:

![The main screen](/images/v0.1.0/screenshot-01-main-screen.png)

You have 3 buttons in the header:

 * On the left, the button to *close* the application.
 * On the left of the right half the screen, the *sync* button: use it to fetch entries from the server and to send local statuses to the server.
 * On the far right of the screen, the *menu* button.

Touching the *sync* button runs a synchronization between your ereader and the server:

![Synchronization in progress](/images/v0.1.0/screenshot-06-sync.png) ![Synchronization in progress](/images/v0.1.0/screenshot-07-sync.png)

Touching the *menu* button opens the following menu:

![The menu](/images/v0.1.0/screenshot-02-menu.png)

From this menu, you can open the About screen:

![The about dialog](/images/v0.1.0/screenshot-03-about.png)

The *menu* button also allows you to navigate between the lists of unread / archived / starred entries:

![The archived entries](/images/v0.1.0/screenshot-04-archived.png) ![The starred entries](/images/v0.1.0/screenshot-05-starred.png)

To read an entry, touch it; and the ereader's internal reading application will start (it takes a few seconds).

When you are done reading an entry, close the reading app by touching the upper-left corner of the screen, and you'll get this dialog, which asks you if you want to change the status information of the entry you just read:

## Troubles?

You will run into troubles; that's what a first ever private beta is all about, afterall!

If you experience problems, two options:

 * Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/pmartin/plop-reader/issues) on github and create one if needed (and if the project is not private anymore)
 * Send me a mail ;-)

In any case: feel free to send me a mail even if you don't run into troubles. I'm really interested by the opinion of some power-users of wallabag, especially if you've used this app in *real conditions* for a few days!
