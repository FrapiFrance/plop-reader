Like *they* say:

> The content of this application can be *deadly* to your ereader device!
> In short, "If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces."

This application is written by people just like you: not-quite-perfect. Which means there might be mistakes, errors, things we did not quite understandâ€¦ In any case, especially if you want to fix something: PRs are welcome!

Also please note that, even if the lead developer of this project works at [TEA, The Ebook Alternative](https://www.tea-ebook.com/), which sells Pocketbook ereader devices, this application is written using a **public SDK**, with **absolutely no *insider-knowledge* at all**. This is also a **personnal project**, not linked to any specific company.
